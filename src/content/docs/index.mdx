## 🚀 What We'll Learn

We’re going from “wait… what’s a server?” to “yep, I built that”:

- 🌐 **HTTP Basics** — requests, responses, status codes, headers
- 🧰 **Core Node** — modules, filesystem, path, process, npm
- 🛠️ **APIs** — REST patterns, JSON, routing, controllers
- 🔐 **Auth & Security** — cookies, JWT, validation, safe defaults
- 🗄️ **Data** — persistence with files, then databases when it’s time
- 🧪 **Debugging & Testing** — logging, Postman/Thunder Client, sanity checks

---

## 🧠 The Mindset

This isn’t “memorize Node.”  
It’s learning how backend systems _behave_ — so you can reason, debug, and design with confidence.

We’ll use:

- 🤖 **AI-assisted learning** (Watts is on the payroll)
- 🧱 **Hands-on builds** — small steps, real outcomes
- 🧭 **Practical patterns** — code organization that doesn’t implode later

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Bring:

- A code editor
- Basic JavaScript comfort (variables, functions, objects)
- A willingness to break stuff… and then fix it cleanly 🔥
