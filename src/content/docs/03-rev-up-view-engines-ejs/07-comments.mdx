Code describes _how_, comments describe _why_. In server-side templates, you often need to document logic that shouldn't be visible to the end-user. EJS provides a specific syntax for internal notes that are stripped during the rendering process.

## The Comment Syntax

To create a comment that is invisible to the client, place a hash (`#`) immediately after the opening scriptlet tag: `<%#`.

```ejs
<%# This comment is for the developer only. %>
<%# It will not be rendered in the HTML. %>
```

### Server-Side vs. Client-Side Comments

It is important to distinguish between EJS comments and standard HTML comments.

- **HTML Comments (`<!-- -->`)**: Sent to the browser. Visible if the user inspects the page source. Use these for structural notes intended for front-end debugging.
- **EJS Comments (`<%# %>`)**: Removed by the server before the response is sent. Use these for documenting business logic, TODOs, or sensitive implementation details.

```ejs
<!-- I will be visible in the browser "View Source" -->
<%# I will be completely removed by the EJS engine %>
```
