A high-performance engine needs fuel, and a dynamic view needs data. Simply rendering a file isn't enough; we need to inject a payload of variables from our server directly into the template's combustion chamber to generate a unique response for every request.

## The Locals Object

The `res.render()` method accepts a second argument known as the **locals object**.

Properties defined on this object do not exist as a single "data" variable inside the view. Instead, the keys of this object are unpacked and exposed as distinct local variables available to the template.

**File:** `/app.js`

```javascript
// Define the data payload
const viewData = {
  title: "EJS Demo - User List",
  users: ["Curly", "Larry", "Josh"],
};

// Pass the payload as the second argument
// The view will now have access to 'title' and 'users' variables directly
app.get("/users", (req, res) => res.render("users", viewData));
```

In this example:

1.  The view engine receives `viewData`.
2.  It extracts `title` and `users`.
3.  Inside `users.ejs`, you can reference `title` simply as `title`, not `viewData.title`.

<div class="next-step">

  <p>The data is in the pipe. Now, let's burn it.</p>
</div>
