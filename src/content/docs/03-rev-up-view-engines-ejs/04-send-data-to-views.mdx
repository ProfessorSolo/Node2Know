A high-performance engine needs fuel, and a dynamic view needs data. Simply rendering a file isn't enough; we need to inject a payload of variables from our server directly into the template's combustion chamber to generate a unique response for every request.

## The Locals Object

The `res.render()` method accepts a second argument known as the **locals object**.

Properties defined on this object do not exist as a single "data" variable inside the view. Instead, the keys of this object are unpacked and exposed as distinct local variables available to the template.

**File:** `/thingRouter.js`

```javascript
const things = [
  { id: 1, name: "Thing 1", description: "Description 1", active: true },
  { id: 2, name: "Thing 2", description: "Description 2", active: false },
  { id: 3, name: "Thing 3", description: "Description 3", active: true },
];

thingRouter.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // Define the data payload
  const viewData = {
    title: "EJS Demo - Thing List",
    things: things,
  };
  // Pass the payload as the second argument
  // The view will now have access to 'title' and 'things' variables directly
  res.render("things", viewData);
});
```

In this example:

1.  The view engine receives `viewData`.
2.  It extracts `title` and `users`.
3.  Inside `users.ejs`, you can reference `title` simply as `title`, not `viewData.title`.

<div class="next-step">

  <p>The data is in the pipe. Now, let's burn it.</p>
</div>
