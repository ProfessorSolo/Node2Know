## Welcome to the Body Shop

When we're doing any server-side generation of HTML, we could build up fragments with brutish string concatenation. But that's like duct-taping a bumper onto a Ferrari. It works, but it's ugly, dangerous, and prone to error.

Instead, we use a **templating engine**. This handles the string interpolation for us, allowing us to "skin" our data with high-performance HTML bodies.

There are many options on the market, each with its own tuning specs:

- [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/)
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/)

But for our fleet, we'll be working primarily with the venerable **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript). Why? Because it's classic, reliable, and handles like a dream (although the syntax is a bit ugly and dated).

## VSCode EJS Formatting Extension

EJS syntax is likely going to mess with our code formatting extensions.

### Quick Fix: EJS Language Support

There is a specific extension that helps VSCode understand the `<% %>` syntax so it stops screaming at you.

- [EJS Language Support (DigitalBrainstem)](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=DigitalBrainstem.javascript-ejs-support)

Install it, and your editor will stop flagging valid EJS tags as errors.
