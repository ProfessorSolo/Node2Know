Listen close. A robust server doesn't just push raw JSON; sometimes it needs to paint the whole picture. Installing EJS isn't just adding a dependency—it's giving your application the ability to construct complete HTML documents on the fly, tailored to every request that hits your line.

## Installation

The EJS package must be installed as a dependency. Unlike middleware that is explicitly imported, Express handles the loading of view engines internally when properly configured.

```bash
npm install ejs
```

## Application Configuration

To enable server-side rendering, specific settings on the Express application instance must be defined. The `views` setting specifies the directory lookup path for template files, while the `view engine` setting defines the extension and internal module to utilize for rendering.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const path = require("path");

// Configuration: Define the absolute path for template files
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));

// Configuration: Set EJS as the default templating engine
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
```

### The Path Module Necessity

Do not rely on relative paths like `./views`. Relative paths are resolved relative to the process's current working directory (CWD), which may vary depending on how the script is executed.

Using `path.join(__dirname, "views")` constructs an absolute path dynamically based on the location of the executing file (`__dirname`). This ensures the application correctly locates the views directory regardless of the operating system or the command used to start the process.
