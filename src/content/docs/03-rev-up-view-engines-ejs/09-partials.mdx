Efficiency in engineering comes from component reuse. Instead of duplicating the same navigation bar or footer code across every single view file—which creates a maintenance nightmare—we extract these common elements into separate files called "partials". These logical units can then be injected into any template that requires them.

## The Include Syntax

To embed another view file, use the `include` function within an unescaped output tag `<%- %>`.

```ejs
<%- include('FILENAME') %>
```

We use the unescaped tag (`<%-`) because the result of the include function is raw HTML that needs to be rendered directly into the document stream. If you were to use the escaped tag (`<%=`), the included HTML would be printed as text strings visible to the user.

## Modular Directory Structure

Best practice dictates organizing these fragments in a dedicated subdirectory to separate full-page templates from component partials.

```text
/views
  /partials
    header.ejs
    footer.ejs
  index.ejs
  users.ejs
```

## Variable Scoping in Partials

A critical feature of specific EJS partials is that **they inherit the data context of the parent view**.

If you pass a `title` variable to `users.ejs`, and `users.ejs` includes `header.ejs`, `header.ejs` can immediately access `<%= title %>` without any extra configuration.

**File:** `views/partials/header.ejs`

```html
<header>
  <!-- The 'title' variable is available here automatically -->
  <h1><%= title %></h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/users">Users</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

**File:** `views/users.ejs`

```ejs
<!-- The path is relative to the current file or root views folder -->
<%- include('partials/header') %>
```
