## The Truck

You've built the highway (Server) and organized the lanes (Router). Now, what are you actually transporting? A highway without cargo is just a slab of concrete.

In Express, the **Response Object (`res`)** is your delivery truck. It's responsible for packaging the data and ensuring it arrives at the client's docking bay.

### `res.send()`

The simplest way to send a response is `res.send()`. It's smart enough to figure out the `Content-Type` based on what you give it.

```javascript
// Sends text/html
res.send("<h1>Hello World</h1>");

// Sends application/json (automatically stringifies objects)
res.send({ user: "Han" });
```

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> Don't send empty trucks. If you don't call a send method, the request hangs forever. The client sits there loading until it times out.
