## Extra Baggage

Query strings are for extra baggage. They don't change the route path itself (the destination), but they carry extra info. You know, the stuff after the `?` in a URL.

`http://localhost:3000/search?keyword=turbo&sort=desc`

In standard HTTP parsing, you'd have to split this string manually. Express, being the luxury vehicle it is, parses these automatically into `req.query`.

```javascript
app.get("/search", (req, res) => {
  const { keyword, sort } = req.query;

  // req.query = { keyword: 'turbo', sort: 'desc' }

  if (!keyword) {
    return res.send("Please specify a keyword.");
  }

  res.send(`Searching for ${keyword} sorted by ${sort}`);
});
```

### The Difference

- **Params (`:id`)**: Essential to the resource. The ID _defines_ what you are fetching. (The Destination).
- **Query (`?sort=desc`)**: Optional modifiers. Filtering, sorting, pagination. (The Luggage).

If you don't send a query string, `req.query` is just an empty object. No baggage, no problem.
