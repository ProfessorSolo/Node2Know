## Bulk Delivery

If we want to send an entire file that already exists on disk as our response, instead of `res.send()` we use `res.sendFile()`.

For example, supposing we have a `pages` directory and within that we have `index.html`.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // Wait... we need an absolute path
  res.sendFile("/absolute/path/to/pages/index.html");
});
```

### The Catch

The path that we pass to `sendFile()` **must be absolute**. You can't just say `./pages/index.html`. Node doesn't know where the truck is currently parked relative to the file on disk.

To find our current GPS coordinates, we use `__dirname`.

## Extra Bits & Bytes

<LinkButton
  href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.sendFile"
  icon="external"
  variant="secondary"
>
  Express API: res.sendFile
</LinkButton>

<div class="next-step">
  <h3>⏭ GPS</h3>
  <p>
    We need a safer way to calculate file paths than just adding strings
    together.
