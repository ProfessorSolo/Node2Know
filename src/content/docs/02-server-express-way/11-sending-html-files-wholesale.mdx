## Bulk Delivery

If we want to send an entire file that already exists on disk as our response, instead of `res.send()` we use `res.sendFile()`.

_Fig 1: Bulk Freight. Moving the entire container._

For example, supposing we have a `pages` directory and within that we have `index.html`.

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Wait... we need an absolute path
  res.sendFile('/absolute/path/to/pages/index.html');
});
```

### The Catch

The path that we pass to `sendFile()` **must be absolute**. You can't just say `./pages/index.html`.

Why? Because Node needs to find the file on the **Server's Hard Drive**. It doesn't know where the "truck" (the running process) is parked relative to where the file is stored.

To find our current GPS coordinates on the server's file system, we use `__dirname`. (More on how to calculate this safely in the next lesson).
