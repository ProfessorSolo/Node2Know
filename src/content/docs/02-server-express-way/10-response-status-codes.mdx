## Cargo Condition

Before you hand over the package, you need to declare its condition. This is the **HTTP Status Code**.

- **200**: Package Delivered perfectly. (OK)
- **201**: New Package Created. (Created)
- **404**: Address doesn't exist. (Not Found)
- **500**: The truck exploded on the way. (Internal Server Error)

Express defaults to `200` if you don't say anything. But if something goes wrong, you _must_ be explicit.

```javascript
// Manually setting the status
res.status(404).send("File Not Found. Checked behind the couch. Nothing.");
```

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> Don't be that driver who crashes into a wall and then smiles like everything is fine. If the request fails, send a 400 or 500 series code.
