## Cargo Condition

Before you hand over the package, you need to declare its condition. This is the **HTTP Status Code**. It's not just for errors—it's the driver's log of exactly what happened.

  alt="Holographic shipping manifest checklist showing 200 OK (Loaded), 300 Redirect (Rerouting), 404 Not Found, and 500 System Error."
  width="100%"
/>

_Fig 1: The Manifest. Everything accounted for._

### The Ranges

- **2xx (Success):** Everything is smooth sailing.
  - `200 OK`: Standard success.
  - `201 Created`: New resource made (like after a database insert).
- **3xx (Redirects):** The resource moved. Rerouting.
  - `301 Moved Permanently`: It's gone forever, update your bookmarks.
  - `302 Found`: Temporary detour.
- **4xx (Client Error):** You messed up.
  - `400 Bad Request`: You sent bad data.
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Who are you? (Login needed)
  - `403 Forbidden`: I know who you are, but you can't come in.
  - `404 Not Found`: Lost map.
- **5xx (Server Error):** We messed up.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: The truck exploded on the way.

### Express Defaults vs Manual Override

Express defaults to `200` if you don't say anything. But if something goes wrong, or if you need to redirect traffic, you _must_ be explicit.

```javascript
// 301 Redirect (Moved permanently to the /things lane)
// Useful for SEO when you change URL structures
app.get("/old-things", (req, res) => {
  res.redirect(301, "/things");
});

// 404 Not Found (Manual)
app.get("/hidden-bunker", (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send("File Not Found. Checked behind the couch. Nothing.");
});
```

:::caution[Professor Solo's Directive]
Don't be that driver who crashes into a wall and then smiles like everything is fine. If the request fails, send a 400 or 500 series code.
