## Professional Monitoring

Why write your own traffic logger when you can hire a professional? **Morgan** is a standard middleware that logs requests automatically.

```bash
npm install morgan
```

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const morgan = require("morgan");
const app = express();

// 'dev' is the log format (concise and colored)
app.use(morgan("dev"));
```

Now your terminal looks like a real hacker dashboard. It tells you the Method, the URL, the Status Code, and how long the request took (in ms).

```
GET /things 200 4.205 ms - 23
GET /missing 404 1.102 ms - 139
```
