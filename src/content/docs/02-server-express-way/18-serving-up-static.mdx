## The Gift Shop

Sometimes you just want to let people grab a soda (HTML), a map (CSS), or a postcard (Image) without a customized route handler for every single file. Express has a built-in middleware for this: `express.static`.

It opens a directory to the public. Warning: It opens the _whole_ directory.

```javascript
// Open the 'public' folder to the world
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

Now, if a file exists at `public/images/logo.png`, the user can access it at `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png`.

### The Invisible Root

Notice the URL doesn't include `/public`. Express looks _inside_ that folder. The folder itself is the root of the static server.

If you _want_ the prefix, you can mount it like any other middleware:

```javascript
app.use("/static", express.static("public"));
// Now: http://localhost:3000/static/images/logo.png
```
