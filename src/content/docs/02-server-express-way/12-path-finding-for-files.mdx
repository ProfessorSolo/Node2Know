## The Path Module

We need to construct the path to our file. We _could_ try to smash strings together like `__dirname + '/pages/index.html'`, but that's reckless driving. Windows uses backslashes `\`, Mac/Linux use forward slashes `/`. String concatenation often results in broken paths.

We use the core `path` module to handle this chaos.

```javascript
const path = require("path");

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // __dirname = The directory where THIS script lives
  // We join it with the relative path to the file
  const fullPath = path.join(__dirname, "pages", "index.html");

  res.sendFile(fullPath);
});
```

`path.join()` is smart. It handles the separators, and it even resolves `..` (parent directory) segments correctly if you need to back up a level.
