## The Path Module

We need to construct the path to our file. We _could_ try to smash strings together like `__dirname + '/pages/index.html'`, but that's reckless driving. Windows uses backslashes `\`, Mac/Linux use forward slashes `/`. String concatenation often results in broken paths.

We use the core `path` module to handle this chaos.

### The Navigator vs The Driver

Important distinction:

- **`path` module (The Navigator):** It purely calculates strings. It doesn't know if the file actually exists. It just tells you "The address _would_ be here."
- **`fs` module (The Driver):** Actually goes to the disk to read/write files. Use `path` to tell `fs` where to go.

```javascript
const path = require("path");

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // __dirname = The directory where THIS script lives
  // We join it with the relative path to the file
  const fullPath = path.join(__dirname, "pages", "index.html");

  res.sendFile(fullPath);
});
```

### U-Turns and Detours (`..`)

`path.join()` is smarter than simple string concatenation. It understands that `..` means "Go up one level".

This is crucial because typically your `server.js` is in the root, but your source code might be in `src`.

```javascript
// Current: /Users/solo/project/src/routes/
// Visualizing: path.join(__dirname, "..", "views", "home.html")

// 1. Start: /Users/solo/project/src/routes/
// 2. "..":  /Users/solo/project/src/
// 3. "views": /Users/solo/project/src/views/
// 4. "home.html": /Users/solo/project/src/views/home.html
```

It resolves the logic before handing the final string to the driver. Safe and OS-independent.
