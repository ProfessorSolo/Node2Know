## The :thingId Lane

Sometimes we don't just want _any_ thing, we want a _specific_ thing. Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. We flag them with a colon (`:`).

_Fig 1: The Designated Lane._

This allows us to create **dynamic routes**. Instead of hardcoding `/users/1`, `/users/2`, `/users/3`, we create one lane that handles them all.

```javascript
// Route path: /things/:thingId
// Request URL: http://localhost:3000/things/42
app.get("/things/:thingId", (req, res) => {
  // Access the param via req.params
  console.log(req.params); // { thingId: '42' }

  res.send(`Details for thing #${req.params.thingId}`);
});
```

The captured values are populated in the `req.params` object. It's like an designated lane pass — it lets specific traffic through based on ID.

### Multiple Parameters

We can have multiple segments in a single route.

```javascript
// Route path: /flights/:from/:to
// Request URL: http://localhost:3000/flights/YVR/LAX
app.get("/flights/:from/:to", (req, res) => {
  const { from, to } = req.params;
  res.send(`Flying from ${from} to ${to}`);
});
```

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> Parameter names are case-sensitive and must be made up of word characters ([A-Za-z0-9_]). Don't get cute with emojis in variable names.
