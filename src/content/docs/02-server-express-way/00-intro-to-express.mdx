## The Standard Server Framework

Listen up. Node.js is powerful raw machinery. It can do anything, but out of the box, it requires you to manually assemble every single piece of your web server. You have to handle every route, parse every incoming data stream, and manage every error by hand.

**Express.js** solves this. It's the standard web application framework for Node.js. It doesn't hide the power of Node; it just organizes it. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including:

- **Routing:** Cleanly defining what happens when a user visits `/home` vs `/about`.
- **Middleware:** A systematic way to handle requests as they flow through your server (like logging, authentication, or parsing JSON).
- **Template Engines:** Way to render dynamic HTML pages on the server.

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> We use Express because we care about **throughput** and **maintainability**. Re-inventing the wheel by writing your own raw HTTP server for every project is a waste of company time.

### A Brief History of Speed

Express was released in **2010** by TJ Holowaychuk and has since become the de-facto standard for Node.js web applications. It is the "E" in the famous **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

Why does this matter? Ubiquity.

- **Documentation:** Millions of StackOverflow answers.
- **Stability:** Battle-tested by major corporations for over a decade.
- **Ecosystem:** Thousands of middleware packages ready to drop in.

## Installing the Upgrade

Express is "unopinionated," which is a polite way of saying it gives you the tools but doesn't force you to use them in only one specific way. It's a minimal framework, so it stays out of your way until you need it.

First, pull into the garage (your terminal) and install the package:

```bash
npm install express
```

This adds `express` to our `package.json` dependencies. If you don't see it there, you didn't install it. Check your work.
