## Why are we even doing this?

Listen up. Node.js is the engine block—powerful, raw, and capable of serious torque. But you don't drive an engine block down the highway; you drive a car. **Express.js** is that car. It's the chassis, the steering wheel, and the dashboard that turns raw JavaScript power into a street-legal web server.

Without Express, handling HTTP requests in Node is like building your own off-ramp every time you want to exit the highway. It’s manual, slow, and frankly, a hazard to other drivers. Express gives us a pre-built infrastructure: on-ramps, routing signs, and toll booths (middleware) so we can focus on the destination, not the asphalt.

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> We care about **throughput** and **clean lines**. If I see you manually parsing URL strings with regex when Express can do it for you, you're walking home.

## Installing the Upgrade

Express is unopinionated, which is a nice way of saying it doesn't care how you organize your glovebox, as long as the car runs. It's a minimal framework, meaning it doesn't come with a heavy navigation system pre-installed. You add what you need.

First, pull into the garage and install the package.

```bash
npm install express
```

This adds `express` to your `package.json` dependencies. If you don't see it there, you didn't install it. Check your blind spots.
