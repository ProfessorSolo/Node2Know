## The Catch-All

By default, if a request makes it to the bottom of your file without matching any route, Express just shrugs. We need a designated "Dead End" sign for lost drivers.

Express matches routes in order. We use `app.all('*')` as the final safety net.

- **app.all**: Matches ALL methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- **'\*'**: Matches ALL paths.

```javascript
// ... all other routes above ...

// The "Lost Driver" Handler
app.all("*", (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send("404: You seem to be off the map, friend.");
});
```

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> Place this **last**. If you put this at the top, it catches everything, and nobody gets to where they're going. It's a road block, not a checkpoint.
