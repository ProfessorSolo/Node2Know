## Service Station Challenge

You've been red-lining the engine for 18 lessons. Time to pull over and check the diagnostics. This lab isn't just about reading the manual; it's about getting your hands greasy.

> **Professor Solo's Directive:**
> Speed is nothing without control. Build this API like you're tuning a race car. Efficient, clean, and no loose bolts (unhandled errors).

### The Visual Anchor (The Pit Crew)

## Lab Specifications: The "Holo-Garage" API

Your client, a futuristic vehicle modification shop, needs an API to manage their inventory of aftermarket parts.

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Chassis)

1.  **Initialize** a new project called `bolo-garage-api`.
2.  **Install** `express` and `morgan`.
3.  **Create** an `app.js` entry point.
4.  **Listen** on `process.env.PORT` (or 4000).

### Phase 2: Traffic Control (Routing)

Create a `partsRouter.js` and mount it at `/parts`. It needs to handle:

- `GET /` -> Return a list of all parts (JSON).
- `GET /:id` -> Return a specific part by ID.
  - _Bonus:_ If ID doesn't exist, send a 404 with a witty error message.
- `POST /` -> "Create" a new part (just log the body and send back a 201 status with the mock data).

### Phase 3: Security Check (Middleware)

Write a custom middleware called `mechanicCheck`.

- It should look for a query param `?role=mechanic`.
- If present, let them through.
- If missing, send a 403: "Unauthorized. Step away from the vehicle."
- Apply this middleware ONLY to the `POST` route.

### Phase 4: Storage (Static)

Create a `public` folder. Add a text file named `manifest.txt` with a list of "Authorized Mods". serve this folder using `express.static`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server starts without crashing.
- [ ] `GET /parts` returns JSON.
- [ ] `POST /parts` is blocked without the mechanic role.
- [ ] Visiting `/manifest.txt` in the browser downloads/views the file.
- [ ] Global logging is active via Morgan.
