## Sorting by Intent

So far we've mostly looked at `GET` requests (sightseeing). But traffic on the Data Superhighway comes in many flavors. Express segregates traffic not just by _where_ it's going (path), but by _what_ it wants to do (method).

Here is the standard CRUD breakdown for our interchange:

| Method     | Action           | Driving Analogy                              |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**    | Read             | Sightseeing. Just looking.                   |
| **POST**   | Create           | Delivery Truck. Dropping off new cargo.      |
| **PUT**    | Update (Replace) | Road Construction. Replacing the whole lane. |
| **PATCH**  | Update (Partial) | Pothole repair. Fixing just one part.        |
| **DELETE** | Delete           | Demolition Crew. Removing the road entirely. |

### Strict Lane Enforcement

Express is strict. `app.get('/things')` and `app.post('/things')` are two completely different roads, even if they share the same asphalt (URL).

```javascript
// GET /things -> "Show me the things"
app.get("/things", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Here is the list.");
});

// POST /things -> "Take this new thing"
app.post("/things", (req, res) => {
  res.send("New thing received.");
});

// DELETE /things -> "Destroy the things"
app.delete("/things", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Things destroyed.");
});
```

> **Solo Warning:**
> If you try to `POST` to a route that only has a `GET` handler, Express will give you a `404 Not Found` (or `405 Method Not Allowed`, if configured). The road exists, but your vehicle type isn't allowed.
