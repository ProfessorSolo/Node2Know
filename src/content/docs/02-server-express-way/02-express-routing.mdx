## Where to, Scotty?

In Express, **Routing** is our GPS. It determines how our application responds to a client request for a particular endpoint.

The structure is simple: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`.

- **app**: The instance of express.
- **METHOD**: The HTTP request method (get, post, put, delete, etc.).
- **PATH**: A path on the server.
- **HANDLER**: The function executed when the route is matched.

### The Interchange

## Our First Route

```javascript
// The "GET" Lane -> Retrieve Info
// Path: Root ("/")
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Engine Online. Hello Express!");
});

// Path: /things
app.get("/things", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Here is the list of things you asked for.");
});
```

> **Solo Warning:**
> Express matches routes in the order they are defined. First match wins. If you have two routes for `/things`, the second one will never be reached. Traffic doesn't loop back.
