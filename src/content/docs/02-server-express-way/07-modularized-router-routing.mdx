## The Traffic Jam

If you keep piling every single route into your main `app.js` file, you're going to create a massive traffic jam. Navigating a 500-line file to find one route is like trying to drive through downtown during rush hour—inefficient and infuriating.

We use **Express Router** to build modular, "local" road networks.

### The Visual Anchor (Express Lanes)

## The Router Module

1.  **Create a Router File** (e.g., `routes/thingRouter.js`).
2.  **Define Routes** on that router, not the main app.
3.  **Export** the router.

### `routes/thingRouter.js`

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router(); // A mini-app instance

// We define routes on 'router' just like 'app'
router.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("List of Things"));
router.get("/:id", (req, res) => res.send("Details of Thing"));

module.exports = router;
```

Now we have a self-contained module. But it's not connected to the highway yet.

    a Base Path.
