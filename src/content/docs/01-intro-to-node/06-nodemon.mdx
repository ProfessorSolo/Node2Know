## The Perfectionist Director

Imagine you're directing a movie scene. Every time an actor flubs a line (a bug) or you decide to change the dialogue (code edit), you have to yell **"CUT!"**, reset the entire stage, and shout **"ACTION!"** again.

In Node.js terms, this is the manual cycle of:

1.  **CTRL+C** (CUT!)
2.  **Up Arrow + Enter** (ACTION!)

Doing this hundreds of times a day is exhausting. You need an assistant who watches your script and _instantly_ resets the stage the moment you rewrite a line.

## The Modern Way: Native Watch Mode (`node --watch`)

In the past, we had to hire external contractors for this. But as of Node.js v18.11+, this assistant sits right in the director's chair!

You can run your script in **Watch Mode**, which automatically restarts the process whenever you save changes to the file.

```bash
node --watch app.js
```

> [!TIP]
> **Why use this?** It's built-in, fast, and requires **zero** installation. For most simple scripts and microservices, this is all you need.

## The Industry Standard: `nodemon`

Before `node --watch` came along, there was **Nodemon** (Node Monitor). It's the seasoned veteran of the industry. You will see it in almost every older Node.js tutorial and existing codebase.

While `node --watch` is great for simple stuff, `nodemon` is like a director with a megaphone and a clipboard—it offers way more control (ignoring specific files, delaying restarts, running non-node scripts, etc.).

### Option A: The "Studio Executive" (Global Install)

You can install `nodemon` globally on your machine so you can use it on _any_ project, anytime.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

_(On Mac, you might need to add `sudo` before `npm` if you get permission errors)_

Now you can run any file with:

```bash
nodemon app.js
```

### Option B: The "Project Manager" (Dev Dependency)

**Best Practice Alert:** In professional projects, we usually install tools _locally_ as "Development Dependencies". This ensures that everyone working on the project uses the exact same version of the tool.

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

You'll see it appear in your `package.json` under `"devDependencies"`.

<CautionBox>
  Since it's installed locally, you can't just type `nodemon` in your terminal.
  You usually run it via an NPM script (which we'll cover later!).
