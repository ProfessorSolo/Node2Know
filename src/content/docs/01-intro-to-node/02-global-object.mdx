## The Site Office

If the **Browser** is a hotel room where the `window` lets you see outside, **Node.js** is a construction site where there are no windows—only a **Site Office**.

In Node.js, this Site Office is called the `global` object.

It’s the central command center. No matter where you are on the job site (in any file), you can always walk into the Site Office to grab the essential tools you need. You don't need to ask permission or import them; they are just _there_.

## What's in the Office?

The `global` object holds the tools that are so fundamental, Node assumes you’ll need them everywhere.

### 1. The Usual Suspects

Some of these will look very familiar from the browser world. They exist in Node too, hanging on the wall of the Site Office:

- `console`: For logging messages (your megaphone).
- `setTimeout` / `setInterval`: For scheduling tasks (your break timer).
- `clearTimeout` / `clearInterval`: For cancelling those tasks (back to work!).

### 2. The Node Specials

Then there are tools specific to the construction site that you won't find in a hotel room:

- `process`: This is a big one. It gives you information about the current Node.js process running your code. It’s like the ID badge and safety manifest for the current job.
- `Buffer`: A way to handle binary data (raw streams of bytes). We'll handle this heavy machinery later.

### 3. The "Sort-of" Globals

There are two special variables that _act_ global—you can use them in any file—but they actually give you information specific to _that specific file_.

- `__dirname`: The absolute path to the folder the current file is in. (Where am I standing?)
- `__filename`: The absolute path to the current file itself. (Who am I?)

## Challenge: Inspect the Office

You don't have to take my word for it. Let's walk into the office and look around.

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Type `node` and hit **Enter**. (You are now in the Node REPL).
3.  Type `global.` (including the dot) and hit **Tab** twice.

You'll see a massive list of everything available in the global scope.

(To exit, press `Ctrl + C` twice, or type `.exit`).

### ⏭ Packing Your Bags

Now that we know where the tools are, let's learn how to bring in outside help. It's time to talk about **NPM**.
