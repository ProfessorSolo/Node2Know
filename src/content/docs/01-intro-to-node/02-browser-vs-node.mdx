## Here are some of the key differences between running JavaScript in the browser versus Node.js.

### **Where it Runs**

Client side (front-end) JavaScript can run in any browser that includes a JavaScript engine.

Node.js, on the other hand, runs outside the browser. Node.js itself is a C++ runtime wrapped around the Chromium V8 Engine.

### **What it can Access and Interact With**

When JavaScript is run in the browser, we are restricted (sandboxed) to the browser environment itself and, most of the time, we are interacting with the DOM.

Node.js, however, runs on whatever machine it is installed on and has access to as much of the file system as any other program.

### **What is the Root Object**

For JavaScript in the browser the root object is the window.

Node.js, by contrast, has no window object.

In Node.js the root is the global object.

```javascript
// browser
window.setTimeout(console.log("Hello, JS."), 3000);

// node
global.setTimeout(console.log("Hello, Node."), 3000);
```
