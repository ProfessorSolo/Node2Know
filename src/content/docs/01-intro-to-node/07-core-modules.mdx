## The Standard Issue Utility Belt

Imagine you just bought a high-end smartphone. Out of the box, even before you visit the App Store, it can already do _a lot_. It has a camera, a calculator, a file manager, and a web browser. You didn't have to install them; they are effectively "baked in" to the factory settings.

**Node.js Core Modules** are exactly like that.

These are the "Factory Settings" of the Node runtime. They are essential tools that the Node team decided were so critical for server-side development that they shouldn't require a download. They are part of the binary executable itself.

If Node.js is Batman, these modules are the utility belt he _always_ wears.

## The Distinction: Built-in vs. Installed

In the next few lessons, we're going to use a tool called **NPM** (Node Package Manager) to download millions of community-created tools. But right now? We don't need it.

We have access to powerful system-level operations immediately, but there is one catch: **We still have to ask for them.**

Even though they are built-in, Node doesn't load them into global memory by default (to save resources). You must explicitly `require()` them.

```javascript title="app.js"
// CORRECT: No path needed for core modules
const fs = require('fs');

// INCORRECT: Node thinks this is a local file you made
const fs = require('./fs');
```

> [!NOTE]
> Notice how we just type the name `"fs"`? Node.js has a lookup priority. It checks for a **Core Module** with that name _first_. If it finds one, it loads it. If not, it looks for a `node_modules` folder.

## The "Big Five"

There are many core modules, but as a backend developer, these are the ones you will reach for constantly:

1.  **fs (File System):** Read, write, and manipulate files on the hard drive. (Browser JavaScript _wishes_ it could do this).
2.  **path:** A utility for normalizing file paths so your code doesn't break between Windows (`\`) and Mac/Linux (`/`).
3.  **http:** The heavy lifter that allows us to create web servers and handle network requests.
4.  **os:** Provides information about the operating system (CPU info, memory usage, uptime).
5.  **events:** The backbone of Node's asynchronous architecture (we'll dive deep into this later).

### Seeing them in action

Here is a quick script that uses three different core modules to spy on your own computer.

```javascript title="spy-on-me.js"
const os = require('os');
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

// 1. Where are we?
const currentFile = path.basename(__filename);

// 2. Who is the host?
const user = os.userInfo().username;
const memory = (os.totalmem() / 1024 / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2);

// 3. Write a report
const report = `
  SECURITY LOG:
  User: ${user}
  System Memory: ${memory} GB
  File Accessed: ${currentFile}
`;

fs.writeFileSync('security.log', report);
console.log('Report generated.');
```
