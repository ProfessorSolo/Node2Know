## The Birth Certificate of a Project

Every living thing has DNA. Every citizen has an identity card. And every Node.js project has a `package.json`.

Without this file, your directory is just a folder of loose JavaScript files with no identity, no dependencies, and no purpose. It’s what transforms a "folder" into a "package." It tells Node (and npm) exactly who your project is, who built it, and how to run it.

_Figure 1: The `package.json` file determines the genetic makeup of your application._

## Creating Life (npm init)

We could create this file manually, but we have tools for that. Open your terminal or PowerShell, navigate to your `HelloNode` directory, and run the initialization wizard:

```bash
npm init
```

This utility will ask you a series of questions. It's an interview for your code.

1.  **package name**: Press Enter to accept `hellonode`. (Pro-tip: npm hates capital letters).
2.  **version**: Press Enter for `1.0.0`.
3.  **description**: "My first Node app" (or something equally profound).
4.  **entry point**: **CRITICAL STEP.** Type `app.js` and hit Enter. This tells Node where the brain of your application lives.
5.  **test command**: Skip (Enter).
6.  **git repository**: Skip (Enter).
7.  **keywords**: Skip (Enter).
8.  **author**: Your name (Sign your work!).
9.  **license**: Press Enter (defaults to ISC).

When it asks `Is this OK? (yes)`, hit Enter one last time.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're feeling dangerous (or lazy), you can run `npm init -y` to skip the interview and accept all defaults immediately. But where's the romance in that?

## The Result

You now have a `package.json` file in your root. It might look small now, but this JSON object is the heart of your project. We'll be visiting it frequently to add **dependencies** (libraries we borrow) and **scripts** (commands we run).

### App.js

If you haven't already, ensure you have your `app.js` file ready to go.

```javascript
// app.js
"use strict";
console.log("Hello Node");
```
