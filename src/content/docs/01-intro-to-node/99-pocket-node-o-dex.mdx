## The Emergency Manual

> "Don't lose this, kid. It's the only thing standing between you and a stack trace." — **Professor Solo**

Welcome to the **Node-o-Dex**. This is your "Hard Hat Required" quick reference for everything we've built so far. No fluff, just the specs.

### 1. Browser vs. Node

One language, two very different job sites.

| Feature           | Browser (The Sandbox)          | Node.js (The Construction Site) |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **Role**          | UI Interactivity               | Backend Logic & Systems         |
| **Global Object** | `window` (The Glass Box)       | `global` (The Foreman)          |
| **DOM Access**    | Yes (`document.querySelector`) | **NO** (There is no HTML!)      |
| **File System**   | Restricted (Security)          | Full Access (`fs`)              |

### 2. The Ignition Commands

The essential CLI tools to start your engines.

| Command       | Action                                                                          |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `node -v`     | Checks your installed Node.js version. The "VIN number" of your engine.         |
| `node [file]` | Executes a JavaScript file (e.g., `node app.js`). Starts the machinery.         |
| `node`        | Enters the **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Your interactive testing workbench. |

### 3. Site Vitals (Globals)

Variables that are always available on the job site. No import required.

- `global`: The top-level scope (like `window`, but for the server).
- `__dirname`: The absolute path to the **directory** the current file is in.
- `__filename`: The absolute path to the **current file** itself.
- `process`: The master control object. Environment variables, args, and exit codes.

### 4. The Supply Chain (Arguments)

Getting materials into the site at runtime.

- `process.argv`: An array containing command line arguments.
  1.  Path to Node executable.
  2.  Path to current script.
  3.  **Your custom arguments** (e.g., `user`).

```bash
node app.js --user=Solo
# process.argv[2] === "--user=Solo"
```

### 5. The Plumbing (CommonJS)

How we connect the pipes. Node's legacy module system.

**Exporting a Module (The Supply Line):**

```javascript
// logger.js
const log = (msg) => console.log(msg);
module.exports = log; // Handing off the tool
```

**Importing a Module (The Intake):**

```javascript
// app.js
const logger = require("./logger"); // Grabbing the tool
logger("System Online");
```

### 6. Async by Design

Node.js is **Non-Blocking**. It doesn't wait for heavy lifting (I/O) to finish before moving to the next task.

- **Blocking (Synchronous):** The foreman waits for the cement to dry before laying bricks. (Bad for performance).
- **Non-Blocking (Asynchronous):** The foreman pours cement, moves to lay bricks elsewhere, and comes back when it's dry.

### 7. Terminal Shortcuts

Quick reflexes for the command line operator.

- **Kill Process**: `Ctrl + C` (The Emergency Stop Button).
- **Clear Screen**: `Ctrl + L` or type `clear` (Sweeping the floor).

### 8. The Toolbelt (Core Modules)

Standard issue gear. No installation required.

| Module | Purpose                                                                   |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fs`   | **File System**: Read, write, and manage files.                           |
| `path` | **Path Manipulation**: Handle file paths safely across OSs (Mac/Windows). |
| `os`   | **Operating System**: Check specs (CPU, Memory, Uptime).                  |
| `http` | **Networking**: Create servers and handle requests.                       |

### 9. File Operations (FS)

Reading the blueprints.

**Reading a File (Async/Promises):**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs").promises; // Modern, Async

// Reading 'manifest.txt'
fs.readFile("./manifest.txt", "utf-8")
  .then((data) => console.log("Manifest:", data))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Lost the paperwork:", err));
```

### 10. Simple HTTP Server

Spinning up a basic web server without any framework scaffolding.

```javascript
const http = require("http");

// Blueprint for the server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === "/") {
    res.write("<h1>Job Site Open</h1>");
    res.end();
  }
});

// Open for business on port 3000
server.listen(3000);
console.log("Server running on port 3000...");
```

> [!TIP]
> **Solo's Pro-Tip:** "Put that 'Live Server' EXTENSION away. We don't use training wheels on this site. You run `node app.js`, you refresh the browser, and you LIKE IT. That's how you build character... and mental models."
