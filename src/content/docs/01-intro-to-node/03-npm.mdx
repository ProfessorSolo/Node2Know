## NPM, the Node Package Manager, is right at the heart of the Node.js ecosystem - and every Node driven project.

It is included with the Node, free, open source, and an indispensable tool for Node development.

NPM is used to install and manage packages, which for our purposes will consist of Node modules and dependencies for your projects.

## Packages

A package is usually a folder that contains a `package.json` which describes details of your project including any other packages that it depends upon.

## Creating Packages

To turn a project into a package, `cd` into the project root directory and run:

```bash
npm init
```

That will ask you a series of questions about your package and then generate a `package.json` file for you.

To skip the boilerplate questions, you can provide the `-y` flag to use all of the default values.

```bash
npm init -y
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use npm to run your program, you can add an entry to the scripts property in package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "dev": "node app.js"
},
```

Then, to run our program from the command line we can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
