## Taking the Corner

A straight line is fast, but boring. To handle the twists and turns of real application logic, we need steering. In Pug, we don't need opening and closing brackets for our javascript logic; we just use the keywords and indentation.

![A steering wheel dashboard. "IF" turns left, "ELSE" turns right. "CASE" is a gear shifter selecting options 1, 2, or 3.](/assets/lessons/04-sleek-templating-with-pug/05-logic-steering.png)

## If / Else

The syntax is cleaner than standard JS. No parentheses required around the condition, and no curly braces.

```pug
- const user = { loggedIn: true, name: "Checo" }

.nav-controls
  if user.loggedIn
    h2 Welcome back, #{user.name}
    button.btn-logout Log Out
  else
    button.btn-login Log In
    a(href="/register") Sign Up
```

> [!TIP]
> **T.A. Watts says:**
> You can also use `unless` if you want to be different. `unless x` is the same as `if !x`. It reads like English, which is nice, I guess.

## Case / When

For multiple conditions (switch statements), use `case` and `when`.

```pug
- const status = "pitstop"

.status-indicator
  case status
    when "green-flag"
      .light.green Go!
    when "yellow-flag"
      .light.yellow Caution
    when "pitstop"
      .light.blue Box Box Box
    default
      .light.red Race Stopped
```

### ⏭ Lap Iteration

Steering is good. Now let's see how many laps we can do.

**Next Lap:** Loops and Iteration (`each`).
