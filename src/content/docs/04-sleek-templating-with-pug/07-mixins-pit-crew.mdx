## Specialized Tools

In the pit lane, we don't build a new tire wrench for every car. We use standard, reusable tools. In Pug, these are called **Mixins**. They function like JavaScript functions but for HTML structure. You define a template "tool" once and strictly reuse it.

## Defining a Mixin

Use the `mixin` keyword followed by the name and optional arguments into parentheses.

```pug
//- Definition
mixin petCard(pet)
  .card
    .card-header
      h2= pet.name
    .card-body
      p Breed: #{pet.breed}
      p Age: #{pet.age}
```

## Using a Mixin

To "call" the mixin, use the `+` symbol. This is the implementation trigger.

```pug
//- Usage
+petCard({ name: "Drago", breed: "Doberman", age: 4 })
+petCard({ name: "Rex", breed: "German Shepherd", age: 2 })
```

## Mixin Blocks

Mixins can also accept a block of content, allowing you to wrap custom HTML inside a reusable container.

```pug
mixin modal(title)
  .modal
    h3= title
    .modal-content
      if block
        block
      else
        p No content provided.

//- Usage
+modal("Security Alert")
  p Unauthorized entry detected in Sector 7.
  button.btn-lockdown Seal Doors
```
