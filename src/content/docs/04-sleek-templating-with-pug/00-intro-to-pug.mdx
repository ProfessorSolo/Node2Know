## Speed Through Weight Reduction

(Professor Solo stands in a wind tunnel, shouting over the roar of a massive turbine. He’s wearing a lab coat that looks suspiciously like a racing suit.)

Welcome to the **Aerodynamics Lab**, cadets! Until now, you've been driving the heavy haulers of the web—standard HTML and EJS. They’re reliable, sure, but they’re built like tanks. Heavy closing tags, bracket-bolted syntax, and angle-bracket drag coefficients that would make a race engineer weep.

Today, we strip the chassis. We’re upgrading to **Pug** (formerly Jade), the carbon-fiber monocoque of view engines. We are removing the steel panels (closing tags) and the heavy bolts (angle brackets) to rely purely on **aerodynamic flow** (indentation). If it doesn't make the car go faster, it doesn't get bolted on.

### The Weight Difference

Sent to the lab by lead engineer **Linus Pug-valds**, this engine is designed for one thing: **Developer Velocity**.

> [!NOTE]
> **T.A. Watts says:**
> Don't get too comfortable with the "it just works" vibe. In this lab, **whitespace is structural**. If you drift your indentation by a single millimeter (space), you hit the wall. Precision isn't optional; it's physics.

## Why We Race With Pug

1.  **Reduced Drag:** No closing tags means less keystrokes. Less keystrokes means faster features.
2.  **Structural Integrity:** The indentation forces you to write clean, nested code. You can't write messy HTML in Pug; the engine simply won't start.
3.  **High-Octane Logic:** Pug has JavaScript baked right into the fuel mix. Loops and conditionals aren't bolted on; they're part of the chassis.

### ⏭ The Pit Crew Setup

Enough talk. Let's get this engine on the dyno and see if it purrs.

**Next Lap:** Installing the engine and calibrating the intake manifold.
