## The Monocoque Design

F1 cars share a common chassis design. You don't rebuild the cockpit for every race; you just change the tires and the aero package. In Pug, we use **Layout Extension** to achieve this. We build one master file (the chassis) and then "extend" it for individual pages.

![Exploded view diagram. A transparent "Ghost Car" (Layout) serves as the base. Different colored "Body Panels" (Views) snap onto it.](/assets/lessons/04-sleek-templating-with-pug/08-layout-chassis.png)

## The Master Chassis (`layout.pug`)

This file contains the common structure: doctype, head, scripts, and footer. It defines "slots" using the `block` keyword where other pages can insert their content.

```pug
//- views/layouts/main-layout.pug
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    title Node F1 Racing
    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/style.css")
  body
    include ../partials/nav.pug

    //- The main content slot
    block content

    include ../partials/footer.pug
```

## The View File (`extends`)

The individual view file declares which chassis it uses (`extends`) and then fills in the slots (`block`).

```pug
//- views/dashboard.pug
extends layouts/main-layout.pug

block content
  h1 Race Dashboard
  p Current Lap: 44/58

  .telemetry-box
    //- Specific content for this page
    +lapChart(laps)
```

## Includes

If you just need to paste a chunk of code (like a navbar or footer) without complex logic, use `include`.

```pug
//- views/partials/nav.pug
nav
  a(href="/") Pit Lane
  a(href="/standings") Standings
```

> [!NOTE]
> **T.A. Watts says:**
> `include` is looking for a file path relative to the current file. `block` is logical inheritance. Know the difference, or your chassis will fall apart on the first turn.
