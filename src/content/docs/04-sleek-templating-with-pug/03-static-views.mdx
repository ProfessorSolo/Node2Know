## The Wind Tunnel Test

We've installed the engine and learned the aerodynamics. Now it's time to build a test chassis and put it through the wind tunnel. A "static view" means the car looks the same every lap—no dynamic data, just pure structure.

In this phase, we ensure that our indentation holds up under pressure and that the Express server can successfully paint the chassis (render the HTML) to the browser.

## The View File

Create a file named `static.pug` inside your `views/` directory.

```pug
//- views/static.pug
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    meta(charset="UTF-8")
    meta(name="viewport", content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")
    title Static Pug Test
  body
    header
      h1 Static Material

    main
      p.lead This content is hard-coded into the chassis.
      p It will not change unless we rebuild the file.

      div.container
        span Indentation Check:
        |  Passed.
```

> [!TIP]
> **T.A. Watts says:**
> See that `|` character in the last line? That's the **Piped Text** operator. It allows you to put plain text on a new indented line without creating a new tag. Useful for keeping your source code narrow.

## The Server Route

Now, tell the pit crew (Express) to render this specific chassis when the driver requests the route.

```javascript
// app.js
app.get("/static", (req, res) => {
  // We don't need the .pug extension here
  // Express finds 'static.pug' based on the view engine setting
  res.render("static");
});
```

### ⏭ Injecting Fuel

Static cars are for museums. We want to race. It's time to pump some dynamic fuel into this engine.

**Next Lap:** Buffered code and interpolation.
