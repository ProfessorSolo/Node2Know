## Reducing the Drag Coefficient

In the wind tunnel, every protruding bolt creates turbulence. Standard HTML is full of drag: closing tags, angle brackets, and redundant type definitions. Pug smoothes all of that out.

This isn't just about looking cool; it's about efficiency. We define an element by its name, and its relationship to other elements is defined purely by **indentation**. If it's indented, it's inside.

![Diagram showing 'HTML Drag' vs 'Pug Flow'. The HTML side has arrows bouncing off closing brackets. The Pug side shows airflow moving smoothly over the indented text.](/assets/lessons/04-sleek-templating-with-pug/02-aerodynamic-syntax.png)

## Classes and IDs

Pug borrows the sleek syntax of CSS selectors. You don't need `class=""` or `id=""` attributes for the basics.

```pug
//- HTML: <div class="container">
.container

//- HTML: <button id="submit-btn" class="btn primary">
button#submit-btn.btn.primary

//- HTML: <h1 class="main-title">Propulsion</h1>
h1.main-title Propulsion
```

## Attributes

For other attributes (like `src`, `href`, `lang`), we use parentheses. Think of these as the tuning settings for a specific part.

```pug
//- Basic Layout
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    meta(charset="UTF-8")
    title Aero Lab
    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/css/style.css")

  body
    //- Multiline attributes for readability
    input(
      type="text"
      name="username"
      placeholder="Pilot Name"
      required
    )
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Solo Warning:**
> Pug does **NOT** use closing tags. If you try to add `</p>` or `</div>`, Pug will treat it as plain text and print it to the screen, and you will look foolish.

## Testing the Airflow (Nesting)

Indentation is the only thing holding your HTML structure together.

```pug
header
  nav
    a(href="/") Home
    a(href="/about") About
    a(href="/josh") Josh
    a(href="/things") Things
  h1 // Pug_View_Engine
main
```

### ⏭ Static Test Run

The blueprints look fast. Let's wind up the turbine and render a static view.

**Next Lap:** Building your first `.pug` file.
