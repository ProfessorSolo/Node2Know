## The Endurance Test

In F1, consistency is key. You need to drive the same lap perfect, over and over again. In templating, we call this iteration. We take a list of data items and render a component for `each` one.

## `each` Loops

The `each` keyword is your workhorse. It iterates over arrays and objects with zero fuss.

### Arrays

```pug
- const drivers = ["Hamilton", "Verstappen", "Leclerc"]

ul.driver-standings
  each driver, index in drivers
    li.rank-item
      span.position= index + 1
      span.name= driver
```

### Objects

You can also iterate over keys and values in an object.

```pug
- const carStats = { engine: "V6 Hybrid", tires: "Soft", fuel: "98%" }

dl.telemetry
  each val, key in carStats
    dt= key
    dd= val
```

## `while` Loops

Rarely used in views, but available if you need to run a loop based on a condition rather than a collection.

```pug
- let n = 0
ul
  while n < 4
    li= n++
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Solo Warning:**
> Ensure your `while` loop has a termination condition that actually happens. An infinite loop in a view render will crash the browser tab (or the server process) and burn out your engine.

### ⏭ The Pit Crew

Doing everything yourself is inefficient. It's time to call in the specialists.
