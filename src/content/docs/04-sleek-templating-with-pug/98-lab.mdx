Professor Solo here. You've read the manuals, you've seen the diagrams. Now, put on the fire suit. We have three jobs in the queue.

Your objective: Fix the broken chassis (HTML to Pug) and tune the engine (Logic).

### 🛠️ Job 1: Tire Change (Maintenance)

**Client:** "Formula Junior" Team  
**Issue:** They have messy HTML scattered everywhere.  
**Task:** Convert this snippet to pure Pug. No closing tags allowed.

```html
<div class="pit-box">
  <h2 class="team-name">Red Bull</h2>
  <ul class="stats">
    <li>Wins: 12</li>
    <li>Poles: 8</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### 🔧 Job 2: Engine Mapping (Custom Job)

**Client:** "Scuderia Node"  
**Issue:** The car renders, but the data isn't showing up.  
**Task:** Create a mixin called `driverCard` that accepts an object `{ name, number, team }` and renders a card. Use that mixin to display two drivers.

```javascript
// Data to use:
// { name: "Charles", number: 16, team: "Ferrari" }
// { name: "Lando", number: 4, team: "McLaren" }
```

> "Act as Professor Solo. Review my Pug Mixin implementation. Did I use the `mixin` keyword correctly? Did I call it with the `+` symbol? If there's a syntax error, roast me gently but explain exactly where the whitespace broke."

### 🏎️ Job 3: The Grand Prix (Solo Special)

**Client:** "Mercedes-AMG Petronas"  
**Issue:** They want a full dashboard.  
**Task:** Create a `layout.pug` with a block for `content`. Then create a `dashboard.pug` that extends the layout. Iterate over an array of lap times and display them. If the lap time is under 1:20, give it a class of `.fast` (green text).

> "Act as the Lead Engineer. I'm submitting my `layout.pug` and `dashboard.pug` for the Mercedes dashboard. Verify my use of `extends`, `block`, and the conditional class logic. If I missed the `.fast` class condition, send me back to the simulator."
