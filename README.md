# Node2Know — Node.js Lessons (Astro + Starlight)

Welcome to **Node2Know**, Professor Solo’s no-nonsense (but still neon) guide to **Node.js** — from runtime fundamentals to building real server-side features.

This repo is the **LESSONS** layer (Astro Starlight). Demos and videos live in their own homes.

## 💥 Modules

| Module | Title | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| 00 | **Course Introduction** | Goals, workflow, tooling, and how we’ll build confidence fast. |
| 01 | **Node Runtime Basics** | What Node is, how it runs JS, and how to think in “server mode.” |
| 02 | **Modules & Packages** | ESM vs CJS, imports/exports, and how Node resolves modules. |
| 03 | **npm Like a Pro** | `package.json`, scripts, semver, dependencies, and sane installs. |
| 04 | **The Filesystem** | Read/write files, paths, streams (lightly), and real-world patterns. |
| 05 | **Async Control** | Promises, `async/await`, concurrency basics, and avoiding async spaghetti. |
| 06 | **Events & Timers** | EventEmitter mental model, timers, and “what’s actually happening.” |
| 07 | **HTTP Fundamentals** | Build a simple HTTP server with Node core (no frameworks). |
| 08 | **Routing & JSON APIs** | Request parsing, responses, status codes, and clean API shape. |
| 09 | **Environment & Config** | `.env` patterns, secrets, and config that won’t betray you later. |
| 10 | **Error Handling** | Operational vs programmer errors, crashes, and recovery strategies. |
| 11 | **Testing Basics** | Node’s built-in test runner + pragmatic test structure. |
| 12 | **Debugging Toolbox** | Inspector, logging discipline, and tracing “where the heck is it failing.” |
| … | _More modules coming soon_ | Databases, auth, deployment, and production patterns (when we’re ready). |
